{#
/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation for the splide-minimal item template.
 *
 * This is a vanilla alternative for splide__slide.html.twig where everything is
 * dumped as is into 'item'. Think of it as a raw individual item output.
 * Choosing vanilla means you are on your own, and want a more controlled item.
 * Be warned! This template is also used by thumbnail navigation which happens
 * to have the same structure and attributes. Be sure to not mess up thumbnails
 * should you need to work with vanilla versions.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - attributes: An array of attributes to apply to the element.
 * - item: A renderable array of the slide content.
 * - item.slide: A renderable array of the (thumbnail) image/background.
 * - item.caption: A renderable array containing caption text.
 * - settings: An array containing the given settings.
 *
 * @see template_preprocess_splide_minimal()
